# Agent Skills Taxonomy

The taxonomy is stored as data in `content/categories.yaml`, not encoded in the
application. Adding or retiring a category is a content change validated by
`npm run validate:content`.

Every skill has exactly one category (the *domain* of the work) and exactly one
architectural layer (the *kind* of work). See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
for the layer model.

All 20 categories below are **implemented** — each has at least one fully
specified skill, which the content validator enforces. Counts reflect registry
version 0.1.0 (76 skills).
